                            <h3>Tiny Storefront: Shopping like it's 1994</h3>
                            <p>This is a faux shopping application that uses the command-line and npm inquirer package as the interface. An SQL database is used for inventory tracking and purchasing. It's almost like you're online shopping with DOS in 1994! This is a class exercise to practice using SQL and linking it to a node app.</p>

                            <p>This program ended up very modular by its nature, since each little operation was often used by more than one other operation. One of the challenges this led to while building it was to make sure the control flow and relationships between each step were correct. I made sure to sketch things out and do multiple intermediate tests to confirm every step was correctly linked to the next, and was being called in order. This necessitated writing callbacks as part of the functions that queried the database- something I hadn't done from scratch much in other work since callbacks have appeared most often in pre-existing methods.</p>

                            <p>I set myself an additional challenge to include UI that could be navigated by a real user with no inside knowledge of the program. I mostly accomplished this by including a bit more explanation in each prompt, especially if it required a decision from the user. I added a couple places where there is a single "Yes" option for the user to select- this was to keep the user in more control of when the view would change, and fix problem spots I found in testing. For example, the starting welcome message and explanation of the app is followed by a long inventory list. If all of this printed immediately, the user would only see the last several items on the list when they first ran the app, which would likely be confusing. To solve that, the app waits for confirmation from the user before printing the list of items. In these prompts I chose the "list" method from inquirer rather than "confirm" because "confirm" always offers "Y/n" options and accepts text input. With the "list" feature, I could specify a single allowed answer and not need to actually handle the content of the response. These prompts are meant to function like an "OK" button in a pop-up - they confirm the user has seen the message and is ready to continue.</p> 
                            
                            <p>In the same vein, I added an order confirmation step which wasn't part of the assignment, because the original behavior of immediate "checkout" after the customer specifies quantity didn't seem realistic. Also, this app doesn't include data validation (since that was not the point of the exercise) but will throw errors when necessary and has catch-all responses to unexpected inputs built into the logic. It should run correctly with typical use, but will probably not stand up to testing for vulnerabilities by other developers.</p>

                            <p>This exercise was to build "Liri", a command-line virtual assistant that can look up information for the user from several APIs including Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB, or execute a command from the included random.txt file. To try it out yourself you will need to add your own .env file with keys for each API, as well as install node and the appropriate packages.</p>
                            <p>This was a more complex program than I had previously worked on, so required more modularization and mapping out of the overall structure to be successful. I'm actually quite proud of the result- I hope you can see the progression here, and the thought I put into trying to make the command line interface more friendly to the hypothetical end user. I made sure to include explicit instructions, greeting messages, and clear error messages. If I were to expand this in the future, I'd like to change the command line interface to use the "inquire" package, or create an html page interface to bypass the command line entirely.</p>

                            <p>This was a project which required the use of Firebase and moment.js to build an application to keep track of train schedules. The application can be used to add trains to the Firebase database and to display all key information about each. The application also uses moment.js to calculate upcoming arrival times and the number of minutes from now until the next train.</p>

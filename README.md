Student Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio for my student work while studying Web Development. I have based the layout on a simple composition book because I found the black-and-white cover style striking and clean.

IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT THE TYPOGRAPHY:
This repository contains DJR fonts that are licensed to PersephoneUnderground (under my real name). You can read the full text of the license in the /typography directory. You must obtain an appropriate license at <https://djr.com> before using these font files yourself.

These fonts are art, professionally created by David Jonathan Ross and his team, who deserve to be paid their work. They even offer some fonts for free for personal use- notably "Input" is available free for coders to use in our code editors. The "Forma" font in use on this page is not an open-source work, so please respect the license and buy yourself a copy if you wish to use it.
